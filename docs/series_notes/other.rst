Python 3 support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This series is the first to support Python 3, allowing users roughly 1 year to switch to Python 3 before the Python 2's end-of-life of January 1, 2020. 
Note that for technical reasons, Python 3 builds are not available for SLF6 platforms. 
In addition, the fhicl Python extension module is only supported for version 1.12.03 and newer.
